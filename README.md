Solutions to Daniel A. Marcus's Number Fields.  I'm working through the second edition published in 2018 by Universitext.

I'm a number theory learner and have been trying to "fill in the gaps" in the proofs that I futz around with in my head and writing up the solutions helps me work through the details.

I try to only write up things that I'm sure are correct, so there's a bunch of stuff missing ;)

I'm focusing on the earlier chapters as those are a bit more accessible and lend themselves to computation.  We'll see how far I get.
